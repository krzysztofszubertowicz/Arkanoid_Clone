# Arkanoid Clone in C++ with SFML
*A self-taught project exploring game development fundamentals and object-oriented programming.*

## Project Goal
The primary objective of this project, developed independently in 2018 prior to my formal computer science education, was to build a complete, playable 2D game from scratch. The goal was to gain a practical, foundational understanding of C++, memory management, and the logic behind real-time, interactive applications.

## Core Concepts & Features Implemented
*   **Real-time Game Loop:** Managed game state, user input, and rendering on a frame-by-frame basis.
*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Designed and implemented distinct classes for game objects (Paddle, Ball, Bricks) with their own properties and methods.
*   **Physics & Collision Detection:** Developed the core logic to detect and resolve collisions between the ball, bricks, paddle, and screen boundaries.
*   **Game Mechanics:** Implemented a scoring system and collectible power-ups (e.g., paddle expansion) that dynamically alter gameplay parameters.

## Tech Stack
*   **Language:** C++
*   **Library:** SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics, audio, and input.
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio

## Development & Learning Insights
This project represents a snapshot of my early, self-driven learning process. It was a challenging and deeply rewarding exercise in problem deconstruction and independent research. While the codebase reflects a foundational skill level, the project successfully demonstrates the ability to learn a complex language and an external library, manage a multi-file project structure, and bring a complex concept from an idea to a fully functional state without external assistance.
